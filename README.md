### Abstract 

Bugsplainer is a novel approach that aims to automatically generate natural language explanations for software bugs, addressing a crucial yet challenging aspect of software development and maintenance. Unlike previous techniques focused solely on bug detection or correction, Bugsplainer leverages advanced transformer models trained on a large dataset of bug-fix commits.

The key innovations of Bugsplainer include its ability to incorporate structural information and identify buggy patterns within the source code, as well as its training approach that exposes the model to both buggy and corrected code versions. This dual training strategy enhances Bugsplainer's understanding of bug characteristics and remediation strategies.

Bugsplainer leverages two key strategies: 1) Utilizing structural information and buggy patterns from the source code to provide context for explanation generation, and 2) Training on both buggy and corrected code versions to enhance its understanding of bug patterns and remediation strategies.

Evaluation using BLEU, ROUGE, and BERT metrics demonstrates Bugsplainer's ability to generate understandable and high-quality explanations per Google's standards, outperforming multiple baselines from the literature. Furthermore, a developer study involving 20 participants found Bugsplainer's explanations to be more accurate, precise, concise, and useful compared to baseline approaches.

Bugsplainer represents a significant advancement in automated bug explanation, with the potential to streamline the debugging process and enhance software maintenance practices. By providing developers with clear and actionable insights into software bugs, Bugsplainer aims to improve the overall efficiency and quality of software development.
